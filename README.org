#+title: Org Website Example

* Why Fork?

Because it is cool to write Github Page in org?

I guess, ha.

So yes, since I already have some experience on making a github page with static site generator

I would love to try taking org up as well

Build locally? No, No, No, Melpa is very unstable in CN, man.

* How to use?

Well, you just fork this (it is ok if you only fork the main branch because the gh-pages would be created if absent)

then do the first commit and push to trigger the build

After that MANNUALLY pick the gh-pages branch with / (root) as the project page setting

visit the desired page and enjoy!
